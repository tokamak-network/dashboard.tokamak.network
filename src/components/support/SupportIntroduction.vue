    <h3 class="subtitle">What is staking?</h3>
    <p class="description">
      The word staking comes from the word stake. Stake means to support, or to
      secure something, such as a tent. In the blockchain space, staking means
      to deposit tokens to support the network by verifying transactions and
      sustaining its stability.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The background for the creation of staking in blockchain is related to how
      blocks are verified. Originally Proof of Work was to secure and verify the
      network, but it was inefficient as it wastes a large amount of
      electricity. Proof of Stake came about as an alternative to Proof of Work.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      As a part of DeFi, staking has become a popular financial instrument, but
      in reality it was created for the security of blockchain networks and to
      incentivize those participating in the operation of the network.
      Participants stake tokens as deposits, and the network provides them with
      interest as a reward for offering this service. Staking with Tokamak
      Network is imilar but different.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Typical Staking based blockchains have one chain with various operators
      and thus the trust of operators wasnâ€™t a significant factor. But for
      Tokamak Networks Layer 2 chains, anyone can open and run a plasma and
      roll-up chain. Because of this, the chain economy must be structured that
      anyone can trust the operator and the data of the L2 chain. The Tokamak
      Network staking system allows for the creation of this credibility.

            Power is issued on the basis of contribution to the network, the same as

            be obtained through contributing to the Tokamak Network, and the more
            delegates it has, the more Power it grows.
